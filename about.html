                This is the site for <b>you</b>.<br>
                I believe that sometimes with simple things someone can impress the people around
                them with tasteful dishes made with Products that <b>you</b> can find in every grocery
                store.<br>
                I really enjoy cooking and I have these books from my mother, grandmother in
                which they wrote amazing recipes that they were collecting during the ages.

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Yoana Churkina. I am an ICT student in Fontys University of Applied Science in
                    Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, but I am from Bulgaria. I always have a passion in cooking
                    since I remember I have always helping my mother,mainly, or my grandma with cooking.
                    I always was feel so happy when other try my dishes and share their opinion about it and
                    they are only positive, so I decided to create this webpage, because I know from my friends how
                    hard is to cook something when you do not what and/or how. I think that the magic is the simple
                    recipes. I believe that with them you can impress your guests, family, friends or lover. So, I
                    hope that this help a lot of people.
